# Progress Components

Progress indicators are UI components that visually represent the status of an ongoing process — either as a determinate progress bar showing completion percentage, or as an indeterminate animated loader or spinner when the exact progress is unknown.

## Progress bar

Usage:

```html
<progress max="100" value="75"></progress>
```


## Spinner

Usage:

```html
<!-- Empty div w/ class -->
<div class="progress-spinner"></div>
```
