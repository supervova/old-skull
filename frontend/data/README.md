# `data/`

This folder contains **static or mock data** used throughout the project.

Use it for:

- Local mock content (e.g. `products.ts`, `menu.json`)
- Placeholder data structures for prototyping
- Fallback values in case CMS/API is unavailable

✅ Data here is **readonly** and manually maintained.

🔄 Replace with real API calls or CMS queries in production when needed.
